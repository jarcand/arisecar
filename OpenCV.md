I had finished a basic demo for opening the local camera to capture and record the video. Three windows of different kinds of video can be watch at same time, and one of them is nature, one of them is handled and the third can show how things in video moved but it seems wired and makes no sense.

The most difficult for me is I don't know the hardware and advanced graphic technology. Is that true we just want to get the view what the tank see then we control it to turn to the right direction? Or the tank can control itself by which it sees?
