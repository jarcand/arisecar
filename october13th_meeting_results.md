# Introduction #

We concluded that everyone in the group needs to download ROS/Ubuntu and begin experimenting with it.

# Details #

There is a java implementation of ROS so we can possibly continue to code in Java. (Or you know, learn C or Python :P)

This is our priority right now seeing as Jeffrey stated that if we move over to ROS we may need to change our architecture.
