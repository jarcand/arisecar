The Pronox security robot project entails a robot that is autonomous to where it is able to detect obstacles and move around the object if the object is in the way of its planned route. Due to time restrictions the robot will only be able to travel a pre-defined route independently, signal the user of any environmental changes, and have pre-emptive collision detection as well as collision detection during its planned route. This entails the robot will stop and signal the user as to its detection of an object, the user will then have to intervene in control of the robot.
